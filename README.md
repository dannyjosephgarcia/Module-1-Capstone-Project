# Module-1-Capstone-Project
The final capstone project for the Introduction to Python module! This README file includes the written instructions on
how to successfully complete the first capstone project. For a detailed visual walkthrough, please watch the 'Module 1
Capstone Project Walkthrough' video in the 'Introduction to Python' module in the course.

### Step 1: Create a New Virtual Environment
If you have not done so after cloning this repo, create a new virtual environment. A visual walkthrough is provided in
the Project Overview video. To create a new venv, execute the following steps:
1. Navigate to the bottom right hand corner of your PyCharm IDE
2. Select the Python 3.10 Interpreter>Add New Interpreter>Add Local Interpreter
3. Select the 'Virtualenv Environment' option on the left sidebar
4. Select the 'New' option and locate your Python interpreter in your system using the drop-down (it should 
be located along the path 'C:\Python\Python310')

### Step 2: Add a new Configuration
To be able to successfully execute your code, a new configuration needs to be added. To add a new configuration, execute
the following steps:
1. Select the 'Current File' dropdown bar located in the top right corner of your screen (next to the 'Run' button)
2. Select 'Add new configuration'
3. Select the 'Python' configuration
4. In the dropdown bar under the word 'Run', select the virtual environment you created in Step 1
5. For the script tab, select the folder icon and navigate to the 'my_team.py' file located within the 'classes' folder 
of the project

### Step 3: Familiarize Yourself with the Code
As with all projects, familiarizing yourself with the code is essential to successfully completing the project.
Go ahead and run the `my_team.py` file to see what happens

### Step 4: Follow the TODOs in the 'your_team.py' file
Using the `MyTeam` class from the `my_team.py` file for inspiration, create your own class for your favorite sports team
with similar attributes and methods. Make sure it inherits from the Parent class SportsTeam.

### Step 5: Follow the TODOs in the 'test_your_team.py'
Again, using the `TestMyTeam` class in the `test_my_team.py` file for inspiration, try to test the functionality of your 
class to make sure you are receiving the expected behavior for the values you placed in!

### Step 6: Follow the TODOs in the 'misc_functions.py file'
After completing all TODOs in the `your_team.py` and `test_your_team.py` files, complete the TODOs in the 
`misc_functions.py` file

### Step 7: Follow the TODOs in the 'test_misc_functions.py' file
Lastly, complete the TODOs in the `test_misc_functions.py` file
